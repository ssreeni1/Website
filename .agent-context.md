## Ready for Parallel Work
The following branches can now be created and worked on in parallel:

| Branch | Agent | Files to Implement | CSS Prefix |
|--------|-------|-------------------|------------|
| `feature/landing-animation` | Agent 1 | `src/landing/*` | `.landing-*` |
| `feature/work-timeline` | Agent 3 | `src/work/*`, `content/work/*` | `.timeline-*` |
| `feature/writing-blog` | Agent 4 | `src/writing/*`, `content/posts/*`, `scripts/*` | `.writing-*` |
| `feature/fun-utilities` | Agent 5 | `src/fun/*`, `src/utils/*`, `content/images/*` | `.collage-*`, `.util-*` |

## Shared Contracts Available
All parallel agents should use these shared contracts:

- `src/contracts/component-interface.js` - Component interface all tabs must implement
- `src/core/events.js` - Event bus for cross-component communication
- `src/core/variables.css` - CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, typography
- `src/core/state.js` - Application state management

## Base Branch
All feature branches should be created from: `feature/core-navigation`

## Pending Integrations
After all agents complete:
1. Agent 1 (landing) needs to call Router.enterContent() when entering site
2. Agent 3, 4, 5 (tabs) need to register with Router in app.js
3. Integration coordinator (Agent 2) will merge in order:
   - feature/fun-utilities (has shared utils)
   - feature/landing-animation
   - feature/work-timeline
   - feature/writing-blog
