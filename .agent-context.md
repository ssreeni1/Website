## Completed Work
- [12:30] agent-2: Created directory structure
- [12:30] agent-2: Set up shared contracts (component-interface.js, events.js, variables.css)
- [12:30] agent-2: Created state management (state.js) and router (router.js)
- [12:30] agent-2: Built tab navigation component (tabs.js, tabs.css)
- [12:30] agent-2: Updated index.html with new scaffold
- [12:45] agent-2: Simplified package.json - removed markdown build system (Writing links to external content)

## UPDATED: Ready for Parallel Work (4 Agents Total)

**Note**: Plan simplified - Writing section now links to external content (no blog system)

| Branch | Agent | Files to Implement | CSS Prefix |
|--------|-------|-------------------|------------|
| `feature/landing-animation` | Agent 1 | `src/landing/*` | `.landing-*` |
| `feature/work-timeline` | Agent 3 | `src/work/*`, `content/work/work.json` | `.timeline-*` |
| `feature/content-sections` | Agent 4 | `src/writing/*`, `src/fun/*`, `src/utils/*`, `content/writing.json`, `content/fun.json` | `.writing-*`, `.collage-*`, `.util-*` |

**Agent 4 now handles**: Writing links grid + Fun image collage + Shared utilities (text scramble, animations)

## Shared Contracts Available
All parallel agents should use these shared contracts:

- `src/contracts/component-interface.js` - Component interface all tabs must implement
- `src/core/events.js` - Event bus for cross-component communication
- `src/core/variables.css` - CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, typography
- `src/core/state.js` - Application state management

## Base Branch
All feature branches should be created from: `feature/core-navigation`

## Pending Integrations
After all agents complete:
1. Agent 1 (landing) needs to call Router.enterContent() when entering site
2. Agent 3, 4 (tabs) need to register with Router in app.js
3. Integration coordinator (Agent 2) will merge in order:
   - feature/content-sections (has shared utils)
   - feature/landing-animation
   - feature/work-timeline

## Content Requirements (User to Provide)
1. **Work Timeline**: `content/work/work.json` - roles, companies, dates
2. **Writing Links**: `content/writing.json` - title, description, external URL
3. **Fun Images**: `content/fun.json` - image paths with links
